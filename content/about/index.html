  <h1 class="display-5">Who are we?</h1>
  <p class="lead">We aren't just a marketing agency, we are digital artisans. We believe that the old-world skills of craftsmanship and precision that are only acquired with years of practice is still as important today as they were a thousand years ago.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">Our mission</h2>
  <p><i>UysDesign</i> design was founded to help businesses achieve their full potentional and to survive and thrive in our trying economic environment. We realized very early in our journey that most businesses are not taking advantage of the incredible marketing tools that are available to them. Our mission is to educate and produce tangible results i.e. more leads and more sales.</p><br>
  <h2 class="h3">Our philosophy</h2>
  <h3 class="h4">Design</h3>
  <p>We believe that the most imporatant goal of good design should be to convey information as effective as possible. Too many companies focus on making website pretty, but that does not necessarily translate into more leads or sales. A website should be fast and painless to navigate to that your potentail customers can find the information they are looking for as quickly as possible. A logo should be memorable and it should be an extension of your brand so that people can easilly form mental image if your brand in their head.</p>
  <h3 class="h4">Marketing</h3>
  <p>While this might seem obvious, marketing is and always will be about getting more sales and more clients, we have seen to many agencies focus on marketing strategies that don't bring in real value <i>read: money</i>. We want to firstly help businesses increase their short term sales and secondly help them to build their brand so that they can grow in the future.</p>
